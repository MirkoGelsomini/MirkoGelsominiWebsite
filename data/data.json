            "content": "Disability nowadays no longer means a condition, an incapacity, or lack that belongs to a body, but rather a product of the interactions between self, society, body, and the variety of interactions from political economies to personal and socio-economical commitments that they engender. From a socio-economical point of view, the rapid growth of these technological resources requires a carefully planned response by health institutions and their administrators. In addition to relevant staff development and training, this response urges to address the cost of technological resources applicable; the individuals' unique needs with which those resources will be most useful; the benefits and risks of using them; the methods for preparing care-givers (clinicians and families) to accept, adopt and appropriate these resources; and an organizational commitment to empirically evaluating their effectiveness and utility. <br/><br/> This work addresses the previous issues by developing the 'Empowerment Framework' in order to offer individuals in the care-giving sector the technological tools, services, abilities, and opportunities to feel empowered in using innovative interactive technologies, adapting them to meet their needs in a process called appropriation, and share their acquired knowledge, original technological approaches, and evidence-based results through a knowledge-based system."

These foundation skills are developed during the first three terms.<br/><br/>The computer skills taught are practical but at foundation level and are accompanied by basic skills in other branches of Information Engineering such as Automation Science, Telecommunications and Electronics.<br/><br/>The engineering training can be completed by two different Study Programmes, known respectively as General and Specific. The General Study Programme includes engineering subjects in sectors outside Information Engineering  (such as, for example, Chemistry, Technical Physics and Mechanics) while the Specific Programme covers engineering subjects within the Information sector and project activity specific to Computer Engineering."

            "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has become the fastest growing disability in the United States with current prevalence rates estimated at as many as 1 in 88 children (CDC, 2013). 67 children are diagnosed per day, meaning that a new case is diagnosed about every 20 minutes, a tenfold increase compared to 40 years ago. These numbers indicate an urgent need for focused and ongoing intervention. <br/><br/>Each child with ASD behaves differently, yet the disorder is characterized by a triad of symptoms related to lack of social interaction, deficits in the acquisition and expression of language, and repetitive patterns of behavior often accompanied by sensorimotor impairments.<br/><br/>This work presents a technological ecosystem centered on the brand new notion of Human To Human Computer Interaction, HHCI, where technology is no more the primary actor (as suggested by HCI) but it is just, simply, a support between the human collaboration.<br/><br/>Our initial body of research started from the Lionheart School in Alpharetta, Atlanta, an excellence in the ASD panorama. A participatory design approach with a strong involvement of therapists, psychologists, educators, and children as players of stories has been carried out with the school. <br/><br/>So far, this interaction paradigm has been mainly applied to 3 classes of different functional levels and involved 20 children aged from 5 to 13. The empirical study is still being carried through video observation, focus group, semi-structured interviews and log files. <br/><br/>Overall children reacted positively to the introduction of the new system and nowadays it is constantly integrated into Lionheart’s activities. Improvements in movement, involvement and engagement with peers were noticed. Furthermore the Occupational Therapist perceived an “unbelievable” progress in motor movements in some kids while educators detected not only an enhancement of socialization but also communication and shared strategy planning.<br/><br/>The project is a continuing work; initial development and testing are promising. The ability to easily create or modify learning material around a child's special interest is seen as a major advantage to engaging individuals in social centric activities. Further work is in progress to test the platform’s ability to automatically collect and analyze data and to create a modular architecture that will make it reusable and adaptable for different developers’ and kids’ needs."

Abowd e della dott.ssa Rozga, con i quali e’ iniziata nei primi mesi del 2013 una entusiasmante e fruttuosa collaborazione. Questa esperienza permettera’ a Mirko di approfondire le tematiche della propria tesi, sperimentare la tecnologia sviluppata in scuole e centri terapeutici locali, collaborare con uno dei gruppi di ricerca piu’ prestigiosi al livello mondiale nel settore Human-Computer- Interaction (il gruppo del prof. Gregory Abowd), e infine stabilire relazioni scientifiche di cui beneficeranno in futuro sia lo studente che il nostro gruppo di ricerca al Politecnico di Milano. <br/><br/>Il lavoro che Mirko sta svolgendo e’ complesso ad innovativo dal punto di vista tecnologico, applicativo e di impatto sociale, per varie ragioni: la natura della tecnologia applicata (dispositivi per l’interazione motion-based touchless); la sfida che rappresenta il target di riferimento (bambini autistici – sulla cui sindrome, per quanto estremamente diffusa, la comprensione profonda e’ ancora molto preliminare) e il grande beneficio che potenzialmente il sistema sviluppato puo’ avere su queste persone; la complessita’ di svolgere studi empirici sul campo al fine di indentificare e validate requisiti e scelte di progettazione (di contenuti multimediali, attivita’, interfacce, linguaggio gestuale)<br/><br/>In ottobre 2013 ho visitato per alcuni giorni Giorgia Tech, collaborato alle attivita’ di Mirko e del gruppo con cui lavora,  ho partecipato ad una giornata di sperimentazione presso la scuola LionHearth per bambini autistici insieme con Mirko e il gruppo con cui lavora, e ho potuto confrontatarmi il prof. Abowd sul lavoro che Mirko sta svolgendo. <br/><br/>Questa esperienza mi ha fornito ulteriore conferma sia della qualita’ di Mirko, che considero tra i migliori studenti con cui abbia mai lavorato, e ha messo in evidenza i benefici – in termini scientifici, professionali, e umani - che egli sta derivando da questa sua permanenza a Georgia Tech. <br/><br/>Il prof. Abowd e’ entusiasta di questo nostro studente, al punto che si è dichiarato disponibile ad accettarlo nel PhD program di Georgia Tech, che rappresenta uno piu’ ambiti e qualificati programmi di PhD degli Stati Uniti. Mirko ha deciso di non accettare questa offerta, e di ritornare in Italia per svolgere un periodo come assegnista di ricerca post-laurea e candidarsi per il PhD presso il nostro Politecnico. Possiamo tuttavia essere fieri della reputazione che questo studente ha costruito presso Georgia Tech, che ci fa onore e contribuisce alla reputazione del Politecnico stesso.  Anche la sua scelta, pur sofferta,  di rientrare nel nostro paese e nella nostra universita’, non puo’ che farci piacere. La collaborazione con Georgia Tech e il gruppo del prof. Abowd e’ di lungo termine, essendo focalizzata su un tema complesso che appassiona sia la sottoscritta che il collega statunitense, e Mirko contribuira’ dall’Italia al proseguimento del lavoro iniziato con la tesi e rafforzera’ la collaborazione tra i due gruppi di ricerca.

It was a very rewarding experience for all of us, and the beginning of what we hope will be a fruitful collaboration with Mirko and Prof. Franca Garzotto. Dr. Rozga and I were immediately impressed with Mirko’s enthusiasm and preparation when he came to Atlanta to work on this project. He is clearly a very passionate person when it comes to developing technology for children and evaluating its effectiveness.  He came with excellent technical skills and a desire to build better skills in human-centered design and evaluation and working with kids with autism. Mirko was a very effective collaborator, both with Dr. Rozga and I as well as with another masters student who was new to Georgia Tech, Ms. Arpita Bhattacharya. In fact, Mirko became both a collaborator and a mentor for Arpita and has put her in a position to continue his work here in Atlanta after he leaves. I am sure he will remain closely connected to the project. Together, Mirko and Arpita built a variety of motion-based games and experiences and have deployed them at the Lionheart School in northern Atlanta. They have continually met with staff at the school to best understand the opportunities to use motion-based technologies (the Microsoft Kinect) to support a variety of behavioral, physical and academic goals of the school. They have interacted with kids of all abilities and ages, and have gained tremendous insights into the opportunities and challenges of this technology for this population.  Dr. Rozga has worked on this project with a variety of students over the past couple years, and I am sure she would agree that in 2 months, Mirko achieved more than others students did in 2 years. I attribute most of that success to Mirko’s technical and collaborative skills. He even reached out to colleagues at MIT to attempt to use their storywriting framework for his project. I can give no stronger evaluation of his work on this project than to say he so impressed Dr. Rozga and I that we encouraged him to consider doing a PhD in this area, potentially with us, in the future.  He has all of the skills, drive, organization and passion to be a very successful graduate student in this area and a successful researcher. It is for these reasons that I highly recommend Mirko without reservation. He has an infectious and sincere personality to accompany his technical expertise, and I am sure he will go far in life. You should be very proud of him."

[...] I know Mirko Gelsomini as a student in my courses, as PhD Candidate, and as collaborator in research projects. He is very effective in achieving goals and able to work with a high degree of independence, while interacting constructively both with colleagues, mentors, and bosses. He could effectively manage a group of  collaborators bringing them to achieve the global goals of the projects, while personally contributing in a substantial way to their success. As a PhD candidate, he was among the best awarded with one of the few scholarship available in our area, and he has been so far very effective in the progress of his PhD track. He was able to pass with success the programmed PhD courses very early w.r.t. to the average, while effectively working on his PhD thesis. He has already published 7 papers in international conference proceedings and there is a good perspective of a significant scientific production in the very next future. As a collaborator in the research, we are working on the application of robots and technological tools in the interaction with children with special needs. This topic matches one of the principal research lines of the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab, headed by prof. Cynthia Breazel, where Mirko is applying to spend his period at MIT. His work there will contribute to the projects they are developing, and will give him the possibility to acquire a strong competence from one of the best research groups in this topic. Mirko is working in this area since his Master thesis, and he is very much committed to obtain significant results with real subjects. Within the project we are collaborating in, he developed innovative robots that have been already tested with more than 20 children with special needs; a more extensive exploitation session is about to start and will undergo in the next months, with the expectation of obtaining a large amount of data and insights on the specific problems that may arise when bringing technology and robots in such a diverse subject population. In conclusion, I strongly reccomend Mirko as a person that could give a significant contribution to the research in his area."
